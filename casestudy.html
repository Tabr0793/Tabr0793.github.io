          <p>Life moves quickly.  As individuals, we take on too much.  Scribble is made to help busy people keep up the pace by enabling us to store information and collaborate online in a well organized, quickly accessible way.</p>

        <h2>initiative</h2>
        <p>Studies suggest a person has an average of 60 thousand thoughts a day (Bruce Davis, Ph.D.).  Thats one thought per second in every waking hour, which means it is impossible to remember every good idea we have, where we placed that article we wanted to read earlier, or which vacation spot had that cute little restaurant we want to visit in 2020.  With a few simple clicks, Scribble acts as an extension of the user's brain by helping them place, retrieve, and share information with ease.

            <h2>user experiences</h2>
              <p>Originally branded as Blocbox, Scribble slowly began to take shape as I began my reasearch.
                  With the help of user experience surveys, I learned many people saving content online bookmark items in their browser.  This can quickly become difficult to manage as there is not a great way to group content or organize the information bookmarked in a person’s browser.   Another critical component I explored in this survey was how people liked to take notes. It became clear we needed a section for categorized
                  notes so users could jot down information in categories as if they were interaction with their own smartphone or notebook.
                  Most people used smartphone apps or pen and paper to write notes.  Those who use pen and paper reported they like how quick and easy it to
                  "scribble" down a note or idea.  Making notes easy to create, and accessible became a clear need.

          <h2>competitive analysis</h2>
          <p>After reviewing scribble's competitors, such as Box, Dropbox, and Evernote, I determined that rebranding Blocbox to Scribble would be necessary as all competitors strove to portray how easy their platform was to use.  Scribble’s name came about to reflect that ease sense of use.  It’s easy to scribble down a note or an idea and save it for later refinement.  Scribble is meant to enable that same freedom
            with added instantaneous organization so that a user’s saved items or ideas never gets lost.

      <h2>user personas</h2>
        <p>Developing user personas showed me that most people need help organizing their daily ideas and extra content at work and at home.  People also shared frustration about current practices that didn't allow them to share and view content from all devices easily.
          As a result moving locations and sharing information with others seemed like it was wasting time.(add personas)</p>

        <h2>design changes</h2>
        <p>After determining user needs, the largest challenge for the design process was developing a navigation system that was simple and easy to use.  After testing several wireframe iterations and mockups, I determined that getting rid of some attributes for the initial launch of this site was necessary in order to simplify my design.</p>
        <p>I also went with a horizontal navigation system because users performed intended tasks more efficiently that way over the vertical prototypes.  Overall, the user testing process revealed people were quite intrigued and happy with the design.  The last thing I changed was the add button.  I made it orange because adding a bright color proved to be the most effective way to draw users eyes
          and get them to perform the intended tasks, which in this case, was to upload an item. </p>

      <h2>conclusion</h2>
      <p>Creating this site from the bottom up has been an incredible experience.  Being that this is the first website I have created, I am proud of the result.  I was able to create solutions to navigational inefficiencies quickly and effectively using the design process bloc taught me.
        </p>
      <p>Although tools in the final design are still limited, it created lots of excitement among potential users.  Revising this application, I’d create a way for users to search information using key words. This attribute would be a crucial need as user accounts became more populated.  I’d also spend more time styling content and incorporating more opportunities for users to edit their space.
        </p>
      <p>Although this project was a success, I still have a lot more to learn.  I will take the process I underwent for designing this website and apply it to my future designs as I continue to build.
