          <h2>scribble</h2>
          <p>Life moves quickly and as individuals, we try to take on too much, but that doesn’t mean we should slow down.  I developed Scribble to help busy people keep up the pace by enabling them to store information online in a well organized, quickly accessible fashion.  While designing Scribble my goal was to create a tool that acted like an extension of the users’ brain.  Discover what went into developing this necessary tool for your business and life everyday.</p>

      <p>Individuals have many different ways of accomplishing tasks, many different forms of work, interests, ideas, ways to collaborate, and the list continues.  It was my job to determine which tools would universally help everybody accomplish their daily endeavors, and to format those tools in a way that people can easily understand and use.<br></br><a href="Scribble Homepage: https://tabr0793.github.io/Blocbox/">scribble homepage</a>

      <p>Studies suggest a  person has an average of 60 thousand thoughts a day (Bruce Davis, Ph.D.).  Thats one thought per second in every waking hour, which means it is impossible to remember every good idea we have, where we placed that article we wanted to read earlier, or which vacation spot had that cute little restaurant we want to visit in 2020.   So I worked hard to simplify users lives by helping them organize their ideas with just a few simple clicks.  This way scribble becomes an extension of every individual and helps them place, retrieve, and share ideas with ease.

            <h2>user experiences</h2>
            <p>Originally branded as Blocbox, Scribble slowly began to take shape as I underwent exploration, leading to Scribble’s current scheme.
            With the help of user experience surveys, I learned many people saving content online bookmark items in their browser.  This can quickly become difficult to manage as there is not a great way to group content or organize the information bookmarked in a person’s browser.   Another critical component I explored in this survey was how people liked to take notes. It became quite clear we needed a section for notes in scribble because every potential user in the survey wrote notes for both personal and business reasons.  Most people used smartphone apps or pen and paper.  Those who used pen and paper reported they liked how easy it was and thought it felt more personal to hand write their information.  Making notes easy to create, and accessible became a clear need as well as easy interaction. ***(insert picture of hand on smartphone taking notes).</p>

          <h2>competitive analysis</h2>
          <p>After reviewing my competitors, such as Box, Dropbox, and Evernote, I determined that rebranding Blocbox to Scribble would be necessary as all competitors strove to portray how easy their platform was to use (but of course Scribble is even easier).  Scribble’s name is supposed to reflect ease of use as well.  It’s easy to scribble down a note or an idea and save it for later refinement.  Scribble is meant to enable that same freedom, but with instantaneous organization so that a user’s saved items or ideas never gets lost.

      <h2>user personas</h2>
        <p>Developing user personas helped me validate the design concepts for Scribble.  It was again made clear that people would benefit from an application that enables users to save images, notes, and links in a well organized fashion.  It seems that most people need help organizing their daily ideas and work content that can then be shared and viewed on any device.</p>
        <p>After determining user needs, the largest challenge for the design process was developing a navigation system that was simple and easy to use.  After developing several wireframe iterations and mockups, I determined that getting rid of some attributes for the initial launch of this site was necessary in order to simplify my design.</p>
        <p>After testing a few prototypes with user testing, I went with a horizontal navigation because the intended tasks were accomplished more efficiently when users navigated the horizontal prototype.  Overall, the user testing process revealed people were quite intrigued and happy with the design.  The last thing I changed was the add button.  I made it orange because adding a bright color proved to be the most effective way to draw users eyes and get them to perform the intended tasks, which in this case, was to upload an item. </p>
